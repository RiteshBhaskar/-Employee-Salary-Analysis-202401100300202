# 📊 Employee Salary Analysis using Linear Regression

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and builds a **linear regression model** to analyze and predict employee salaries based on their experience.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- ✅ Created a custom dataset of 20 employees
- ✅ Performed EDA using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- ✅ Used **MinMaxScaler** for salary normalization
- ✅ Visualized salary distributions and correlations
- ✅ Built and evaluated a **Linear Regression** model

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

- `Age`  
- `Department` (Finance, HR, IT, Sales)  
- `Experience` (Years)  
- `Salary` (Normalized)

---

- **Feature:** Experience  
- **Target:** Salary (normalized)

### 📉 Model Performance

| Metric                | Value   |
|-----------------------|---------|
| R-squared             | -0.114  |
| Mean Absolute Error   | 0.319   |
| Mean Squared Error    | 0.137   |

> Note: A negative R² score suggests the model does not fit the data well.
